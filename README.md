# Biopython Project

This project demonstrates the use of the `biopython` library for sequence alignment.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Create a new folder and Open `CMD` (Command Prompt) in that folder and run the following command to clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azam-hub/biopython_project.git .
```

### Step 2: Install Conda (If Not Installed)
If you do not have Conda installed, you can download and install it from [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

### Step 3: Create the Conda Environment
Navigate to the project directory where you cloned the repository. Run the following command to create the Conda environment using the `environment.yml` file:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

### Step 4: Activate the Conda Environment
Once the environment is created, activate it using the following command:

```bash
conda activate myenv
```

### Step 5: Run the Project
Now you can run the main script with Python. Use the following command to execute the project:

```bash
python main.py
```

<!-- ### Step 6: Deactivate the Conda Environment (Optional)
Once you're done working with the project, you can deactivate the Conda environment by running:

```bash
conda deactivate
```

### Step 7: Updating Dependencies
If there are any updates to the project's dependencies, you can update your environment by running:

```bash
conda env update -f environment.yml
```

### Step 8: Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues during the setup or execution of the project, here are a few common troubleshooting tips:

1. **Conda Environment Not Found**: If you receive an error about the Conda environment not being found, ensure that you have activated the environment using:

    ```bash
    conda activate myenv
    ```

2. **Package Installation Issues**: If certain packages fail to install or dependencies conflict, try updating Conda and the environment:

    ```bash
    conda update conda
    conda env update -f environment.yml
    ```

3. **Python Version Compatibility**: Ensure that you're using a compatible Python version for the project. You can check your Python version with:

    ```bash
    python --version
    ```

    If needed, you can specify a Python version when creating the environment by editing the `environment.yml` file.

4. **Missing Dependencies**: If you notice that certain dependencies are missing or not listed in `environment.yml`, install them manually using:

    ```bash
    conda install <package-name>
    ```

### Step 9: Contributing
If you'd like to contribute to the project, feel free to fork the repository, create a branch, and submit a pull request with your changes. Please ensure your code is well-documented and passes any tests before submitting.
